# NED - News Event Detection Dataset

Welcome to the repository for the News Event Detection (NED) Dataset. This dataset is a comprehensive collection designed for the advancement of news event detection algorithms within the field of computational journalism and social media analysis.

## Dataset Overview
The NED dataset consists of 17,366 Twitter posts, each paired with corresponding images, meticulously annotated with 40 real-world events. NED encompasses a wide array of event themes such as political events (elections, referendums, political crises, protests), sports events (the Olympics, soccer matches), and natural disasters (hurricanes, floods), amongst others. With the inclusion of events with subtle differences (e.g., “2016 Summer Olympics” vs. “2018 Winter Olympics”), NED presents a challenging landscape for detection algorithms, simulating the complexity encountered in real-world scenarios.
